Hello? Is this thing on?

So here I go again, attempting to write a blog.  I'm not sure why I bother ever attempting it.  I never keep it up.

I know why I'm attempting it this time.  I'm not very good at getting my thoughts down, I've never been very good at it, it's always been a bit of a struggle.  So this is my attempt at forcing myself to improve.

As I move on in my career I've managed to improve in many aspects but writing isn't one of those.  So this is my attempt at giving myself the opportunity to improve.  I would like to try and write something at least once a month.

I'm 100% sure what I'm going to write about but it'll probably just be a mix of stuff about work and hobbies.  Some code, some beer and probably games.
